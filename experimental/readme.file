Core Components:

Uses PL_MPEG library for MPEG decoding
KallistiOS (KOS) for Dreamcast development
PowerVR (PVR) for rendering


Key Features:

2MB streaming buffer for smooth playback
YUV422 texture format for video rendering
Audio streaming support
FPS counting and display
Buffer management with refill tracking


Main Functions:
a. initialize_stream_buffer(): Sets up the 2MB buffer for streaming
b. cleanup_stream_buffer(): Frees allocated buffer memory
c. display_draw(): Renders the video frame using PVR
d. app_on_video(): Processes each video frame
e. sound_callback(): Handles audio streaming
f. Mpeg1Play(): Main playback function
Key Optimizations:

Direct rendering for improved performance
Minimum buffer fill level before playback starts
Optimized buffer refill process
YUV data verification for debugging

Debug Information:

FPS counter
Buffer refill count
Remaining buffer size
YUV data averages (commented out)

Implmented DEBUG_PRINT macro for correct file and line number formatting
Modified format specifiers in Mpeg1Play for uint32_t variables


DMA version is full speed all the time on DC emulators and hardware but there is glitch on hardware
